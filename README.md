Space Trader
============

Space Trader is a resource trading and arbitrage game, inspired by dope wars,
merchant of the skies and others.

In this game, you play the commander of a trading vessel (for a wide definition
of trading vessel) with the goal of amassing as many credits as possible, so
that you can get out of the rat race and retire on a quiet backwater planet
with your collection of banzai trees. 

In the real world, as players connect to the server, their public ip address
determines which location that they are playing at.  Each location can host
several points of interest, such as wandering merchants who deal in legitimate
wares that you may trade with, local constabulary who may wish to detain you
for your supposed misdeeds, and even vicious reavers who offer nothing but
misery and misfortune.

Buy, barter, sell or steal in order to amass resources, and ultimately currency
so that you can finally realize your dreams of taking it easy for as long as
you damn well please, but beware it may be more challenging that it seems.
